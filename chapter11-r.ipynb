    "we count occurrences of words from an *a priori* defined list of words.\n",
    "In <a href=\"#sec-supervised\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Section 1.4</a>, we\n",

    "defined lists or coding schemes, but inductively extract topics from our\n",
    "data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deciding on the Right Method\n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking about the computational analysis of texts, it is important\n",
    "to realize that there is no method that is *the one* to do so. While\n",
    "there are good choices and bad choices, we also cannot say that one\n",
    "method is necessarily and always superior to another. Some methods are\n",
    "more fashionable than others. For instance, there has been a growing\n",
    "interest in topic models (see\n",
    "<a href=\"#sec-unsupervised\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Section 1.5</a>) in the\n",
    "past few years. There are indeed very good applications for such models,\n",
    "they are also sometimes applied to research questions and/or data where\n",
    "they make much less sense. As always, the choice of method should follow\n",
    "the research question and not the other way round. We therefore caution\n",
    "you about reading\n",
    "<a href=\"#sec-chap-text\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Section 1</a> selectively\n",
    "because you want, for instance, to learn about supervised machine\n",
    "learning or about unsupervised topic models. Instead, you should be\n",
    "aware of very different approaches to make an informed decision on what\n",
    "to use when.\n",
    "\n",
    "@Boumans2016 provide useful guidelines for this. They place automatic\n",
    "text analysis approaches on a continuum from deductive (or top-down) to\n",
    "inductive (or bottom-up). At the deductive end of the spectrum, they\n",
    "place dictionary approaches\n",
    "(<a href=\"#sec-dictionary\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Section 1.3</a>). Here,\n",
    "the researcher has strong *a priori* (theoretical) assumptions (for\n",
    "instance, which topics exist in a news data set; or which words are\n",
    "positive or negative) and can compile lists of words or rules based on\n",
    "these assumptions. The computer then only needs to execute these rules.\n",
    "At the inductive end of the spectrum, in contrast, lie approaches such\n",
    "as topic models\n",
    "(<a href=\"#sec-unsupervised\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Section 1.5</a>) where\n",
    "little or no *a priori* assumptions are made, and where we exploratively\n",
    "look for patterns in the data. Here, we typically do not know which\n",
    "topics exist in advance. Supervised approaches\n",
    "(<a href=\"#sec-supervised\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Section 1.4</a>) can be\n",
    "placed in between: here, we do define categories *a priori* (we do know\n",
    "which topics exist, and given an article, we know to which topic it\n",
    "belongs), but we do not have any set of rules: we do not know which\n",
    "words to look for or which exact rules to follow. These rules are to be\n",
    "“learned” by the computer from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the details and implementations, let us discuss some\n",
    "use cases of the three main approaches for the computational analysis of\n",
    "text: dictionary (or rule-based) approaches, supervised machine\n",
    "learning, and unsupervised machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary approaches excel under three conditions. First, the variable\n",
    "we want to code is *manifest and concrete* rather than *latent and\n",
    "abstract*: names of actors, specific physical objects, specific phrases,\n",
    "etc., rather than feelings, frames, or topics. Second, all synonyms to\n",
    "be included must be known beforehand. And third, the dictionary entries\n",
    "must not have multiple meanings. For instance, coding for how often gun\n",
    "control is mentioned in political speeches fits these criteria. There\n",
    "are only so many ways to talk about it, and it is rather unlikely that\n",
    "speeches about other topics contain a phrase like “gun control”.\n",
    "Similarly, if we want to find references to Angela Merkel, Donald Trump,\n",
    "or any other well-known politician, we can just directly search for\n",
    "their names – even though problems arise when people have very common\n",
    "surnames and are referred to by their surnames only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sadly, most interesting concepts are more complex to code. Take a\n",
    "seemingly straightforward problem: distinguishing whether a news article\n",
    "is about the economy or not. This is really easy to do for humans: there\n",
    "may be some edge cases, but in general, people rarely need longer than a\n",
    "few seconds to grasp whether an article is about the economy rather than\n",
    "about sports, culture, etc. Yet, many of these articles won’t directly\n",
    "state that they are about the economy by explicitly using the word\n",
    "“economy”.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may think of extending our dictionary not only with `econom.+` (a\n",
    "regular expression that includes economists, economic, and so on), but\n",
    "also come up with other words like “stock exchange”, “market”,\n",
    "“company.” Unfortunately, we will quickly run into a problem that we\n",
    "also faced when we discussed the precision-recall trade-off in\n",
    "**?@sec-validation**: the more terms we add to our dictionary, the more\n",
    "false positives we will get: articles about the geographical space\n",
    "called “market”, about some celebrity being seen in “company” of someone\n",
    "else, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this example, we can conclude that often (1) it is easy for humans\n",
    "to decide to which class a text belongs, but (2) it is very hard for\n",
    "humans to come up with a list of words (or rules) on which their\n",
    "judgment is based. Such a situation is perfect for applying supervised\n",
    "machine learning: after all, it won’t take us much time to annotate,\n",
    "say, 1000 articles based on whether they are about the economy or not\n",
    "(probably this takes less time than thoroughly fine tuning a list of\n",
    "words to include or exclude); and the difficult part, deciding on the\n",
    "exact rules underlying the decision to classify an article as economic\n",
    "is done by the computer in seconds. Supervised machine learning,\n",
    "therefore, has replaced dictionary approaches in many areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both dictionary (or rule-based) approaches and supervised machine\n",
    "learning assume that you know in advance which categories (positive\n",
    "versus negative; sports versus economy versus politics; …) exist. The\n",
    "big strength of unsupervised approaches such as topic models is that you\n",
    "can also apply them without this knowledge. They therefore allow you to\n",
    "find patterns in data that you did not expect and can generate new\n",
    "insights. This makes them particularly suitable for explorative research\n",
    "questions. Using them for confirmatory tests, in contrast, is less\n",
    "defensible: after all, if we are interested in knowing whether, say,\n",
    "news site A published more about the economy than news site B, then it\n",
    "would be a bit weird to pretend not to know that the topic “economy”\n",
    "exists. Also practically, mapping the resulting topics that the topic\n",
    "model produces onto such *a priori* existing categories can be\n",
    "challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite all differences, all approaches share one requirement: you need\n",
    "to “Validate. Validate. Validate” \\[@Grimmer2013\\]. Though it has been\n",
    "done in the past, simply applying a dictionary without comparing the\n",
    "performance to manual coding of the same concepts is not acceptable;\n",
    "neither is using a supervised machine learning classifier without doing\n",
    "the same; or blindly trusting a topic model without at least manually\n",
    "checking whether the scores the model assigns to documents really\n",
    "capture what the documents are about.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Obtaining a Review Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sections on dictionary and supervised approaches we will use a\n",
    "dataset of movie reviews from the IMDB database \\[@aclimdb\\]. This\n",
    "dataset is published as a compressed set of folders, with separate\n",
    "folders for the train and test datasets and subfolders for positive and\n",
    "negative reviews. Lots of other review datasets are available online,\n",
    "for example for Amazon review data\n",
    "([jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/](https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The IMDB dataset we will use is a relatively large file and it requires\n",
    "bit of processing, so it is smart to *cache* the data rather than\n",
    "downloading and processing it every time you need it. This is done in\n",
    "<a href=\"#exm-reviewdata\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Example 1</a>, which also\n",
    "serves as a nice example of how to download and process files. Both R\n",
    "and Python follow the same basic pattern. First, we check whether the\n",
    "cached file exists, and if it does we read the data from that file. For\n",
    "R, we use the standard *RDS* format, while for Python we use a\n",
    "compressed *pickle* file. The format of the data is also slightly\n",
    "different, following the convention for each language: In R we use the\n",
    "data frame returned by `readtext`, which can read files from a folder or\n",
    "zip archive and return a data frame containing one text per row. In\n",
    "Python, we have separate lists for the train and test datasets and for\n",
    "the full texts and labels: `text_train` are the training texts and\n",
    "`y_train` are the corresponding labels.\n",

    "from the downloaded file directly, so we do not need to explicitly\n",
    "extract it. We loop over all files in the archive, and use a regular\n",
    "expression to select only text files and extract the label and dataset\n",
    "name (see **?@sec-regular** for more information about regular\n",
    "expressions). Then, we extract the text from the archive, and add the\n",
    "text and the label to the appropriate list. Finally, the data is saved\n",
    "as a compressed pickle file, so the next time we run this cell it does\n",

    "## Dictionary Approaches to Text Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "A straightforward way to automatically analyze text is to compile a list\n",
    "of terms you are interested in and simply count how often they occur in\n",
    "each document. For example, if you are interested in finding out whether\n",
    "mentions of political parties in news articles change over the years,\n",
    "you only need to compile a list of all party names and write a small\n",
    "script to count them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, this is how sentiment analysis was done. Example\n",
    "<a href=\"#exm-sentsimple\" class=\"quarto-xref\">2</a> shows how to do a\n",
    "simple sentiment analysis based on a list of positive and negative\n",
    "words. The logic is straightforward: you count how often each positive\n",
    "word occurs in a text, you do the same for the negative words, and then\n",
    "determine which occur more often.\n",
    "\n",

    "As you may already realize, there are a lot of downsides to this\n",
    "approach. Most notably, our bag-of-words approach does not allow us to\n",
    "account for negation: “not good” will be counted as positive. Relatedly,\n",
    "we cannot handle modifiers such as “very good”. Also, all words are\n",
    "either positive or negative, while “great” should be more positive than\n",
    "“good”. More advanced dictionary-based sentiment analysis packages like\n",
    "Vader \\[@Hutto2014\\] or SentiStrength \\[@Thelwall2012\\] include such\n",
    "functionalities. Yet, as we will discuss in Section\n",
    "<a href=\"#sec-supervised\" class=\"quarto-xref\">1.4</a>, also these\n",
    "off-the-shelf packages perform very poorly in many sentiment analysis\n",
    "tasks, especially outside of the domains they were developed for.\n",
    "Dictionary-based sentiment analysis has been shown to be problematic\n",
    "when analyzing news content (e.g. @Gonzalez-Bailon2015; @Boukes2019).\n",
    "They are problematic when accuracy at the sentence level is important,\n",
    "but may be satisfactory with longer texts for comparatively easy tasks\n",
    "such as movie review classification \\[@Reagan2017\\], where there is\n",
    "clear ground truth data and the genre convention implies that the whole\n",
    "text is evaluative and evaluates one object (the film).\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, there are many use cases where dictionary approaches work very\n",
    "well. Because your list of words can contain anything, not just positive\n",
    "or negative words, dictionary approaches have been used, for instance,\n",
    "to measure the use of racist words or swearwords in online fora \\[e.g.,\n",
    "@Tulkens2016\\]. Dictionary approaches are simple to understand and\n",
    "straightforward, which can be a good argument for using them when it is\n",
    "important that the method is no black-box but fully transparent even\n",
    "without technical knowledge. Especially when the dictionary already\n",
    "exists or is easy to create, it is also a very cheap method. However,\n",
    "this is at the expense of their limitation to only performing well when\n",
    "measuring easy to operationalize concepts. To put it bluntly: it’s great\n",
    "for measuring the visibility of parties or organizations in the news,\n",
    "but it’s not good for measuring concepts such as emotions or frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "What gave dictionary approaches a bit of a bad name is that many\n",
    "researchers applied them without validating them. This is especially\n",
    "problematic when a dictionary is applied in a slightly different domain\n",
    "than that for which it was originally made.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use a dictionary-based approach, we advise the following\n",
    "procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Construct a dictionary based on theoretical considerations and by\n",
    "    closely reading a sample of example texts.\n",
    "    -   Code some articles manually and compare with the automated\n",
    "        coding.\n",
    "    -   Improve your dictionary and check again.\n",
    "    -   Manually code a validation dataset of sufficient size. The\n",
    "        required size depends a bit on how balanced your data is – if\n",
    "        one code occurs very infrequently, you will need more data.\n",
    "    -   Calculate the agreement. You could use standard intercoder\n",
    "        reliability measures used in manual content analysis, but we\n",
    "        would also advise you to calculate precision and recall (see\n",
    "        Section **?@sec-validation**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Very extensive dictionaries will have a high recall (it becomes\n",

    "## Unsupervised Text Analysis: Topic Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In **?@sec-clustering**, we discussed how clustering techniques can be\n",
    "used to find patterns in data, such as which cases or respondents are\n",
    "most similar. Similarly, especially in survey research it is common to\n",
    "use factor analysis to discover (or confirm) variables that form a\n",
    "scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the idea behind these techniques is similar: by\n",
    "understanding the regularities in the data (which cases or variables\n",
    "behave similarly), you can describe the relevant information in the data\n",
    "with fewer data points. Moreover, assuming that the regularities capture\n",
    "interesting information and the deviations from these regularities are\n",
    "mostly uninteresting noise, these clusters of cases or variables can\n",
    "actually be substantively informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a document-term matrix (DTM) is “just” a matrix, you can also\n",
    "apply these clustering techniques to the DTM to find groups of words or\n",
    "documents. You can therefore use any of the techniques we described in\n",
    "**?@sec-chap-eda**, and in particular clustering techniques such as\n",
    "$k$-means clustering (see **?@sec-clustering**) to group documents that\n",
    "use similar words together.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be very instructive to do this, and we encourage you to play\n",
    "around with such techniques. However, in recent years, a set of models\n",
    "called *topic models* have become especially popular for the\n",
    "unsupervised analysis of texts. Very much what like what you would do\n",
    "with other unsupervised techniques, also in topic modeling, you group\n",
    "words and documents into “topics”, consisting of words and documents\n",
    "that co-vary. If you see the word “agriculture” in a news article, there\n",
    "is a good chance you might find words such as “farm” or “cattle”, and\n",
    "there is a lower chance you will find a word like “soldier”. In other\n",
    "words, the words “agriculture” and “farm” generally occur in the same\n",
    "kind of documents, so they can be said to be part of the same topic.\n",
    "Similarly, two documents that share a lot of words are probably about\n",
    "the same topic, and if you know what topic a document is on (e.g., an\n",
    "agricultural topic), you are better able to guess what words might occur\n",
    "in that document (e.g., “cattle”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can formulate the goal of topic modeling as: given a corpus,\n",
    "find a set of $n$ topics, consisting of specific words and/or documents,\n",
    "that minimize the mistakes we would make if we try to reconstruct the\n",
    "corpus from the topics. This is similar to regression where we try to\n",
    "find a line that minimizes the prediction error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In early research on document clustering, a technique called Latent\n",
    "Semantic Analysis (LSA) essentially used a factor analysis technique\n",
    "called Singular Value Decomposition (see **?@sec-pcasvd**) on the DTM.\n",
    "This has yielded promising results in information retrieval (i.e.,\n",
    "document search) and studying human memory and language use. However, it\n",
    "has a number of drawbacks including factor loadings that can be\n",
    "difficult to interpret substantively and is not a good way of dealing\n",
    "with words that can have multiple meanings \\[@lsa\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most widely used technique for topic modeling is Latent Dirichlet\n",
    "Allocation \\[LDA, @blei03\\]. Although the goal of LDA is the same as for\n",
    "clustering techniques, it starts from the other end with what is called\n",
    "a *generative model*. A generative model is a (simplified) formal model\n",
    "of how the data is assumed to have been generated. For example, if we\n",
    "would have a standard regression model predicting income based on age\n",
    "and education level, the implicit generative model is that to determine\n",
    "someone’s income, you take their age and education level, multiply them\n",
    "both by their regression parameters, and then add the intercept and some\n",
    "random error. Of course, we know that’s not actually how most companies\n",
    "determine wages, but it can be a useful starting point to analyze, e.g.,\n",
    "labor market discrimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generative model behind LDA works as follows. Assume that you are a\n",
    "journalist writing a 500 word news item. First, you would choose one or\n",
    "more *topics* to write about, for example 70% healthcare and 30%\n",
    "economy. Next, for each word in the item, you randomly pick one of these\n",
    "topics based on their respective weight. Finally, you pick a random word\n",
    "from the words associated with that topic, where again each word has a\n",
    "certain probability for that topic. For example, “hospital” might have a\n",
    "high probability for healthcare while “effectiveness” might have a lower\n",
    "probability but could still occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "As said, we know (or at least strongly suspect) that this is not how\n",
    "journalists actually write their stories. However, this generative model\n",
    "helps understand the substantive interpretation of topics. Moreover, LDA\n",
    "is a *mixture model*, meaning it allows for each document to be about\n",
    "multiple topics, and for each word to occur in multiple topics. This\n",
    "matches with the fact that in many cases, our documents are in fact\n",
    "about multiple topics, from a news article about the economic effects of\n",
    "the COVID virus to an open survey answer containing multiple reasons for\n",
    "supporting a certain candidate. Additionally, since topic assignment is\n",
    "based on what other words occur in a document, the word “pupil” could be\n",
    "assigned either to a “biology” topic or to an “education” topic,\n",
    "depending on whether the document talks about eyes and lenses or about\n",
    "teachers and classrooms.\n",
    "\n",

    "Figure <a href=\"#fig-lda\" class=\"quarto-xref\">1</a> is a more formal\n",
    "notation of the same generative model. Starting from the left, for each\n",
    "document you pick a set of topics $\\Theta$. This set of topics is drawn\n",
    "from a *Dirichlet distribution* which itself has a parameter $\\alpha$\n",
    "(see note). Next, for each word you select a single topic $z$ from the\n",
    "topics in that document. Finally, you pick an actual word $w$ from the\n",
    "words in that topic, again controlled by a parameter $\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we know which words and documents are in which topics, we can\n",
    "start generating the documents in the corpus. In reality, of course, we\n",
    "have the reverse situation: we know the documents, and we want to know\n",
    "the topics. Thus, the task of LDA is to find the parameters that have\n",
    "the highest chance of generating these documents. Since only the word\n",
    "frequencies are observed, this is a latent variable model where we want\n",
    "to find the most likely values for the (latent) topic $z$ for each word\n",
    "in each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is no simple analytic solution to calculate these\n",
    "topic assignments like there is for OLS regression. Thus, like other\n",
    "more complicated statistical models such as multilevel regression, we\n",
    "need to use an iterative estimation that progressively optimizes the\n",
    "assignment to improve the fit until it converges.\n",
    "\n",
    "An estimation method that is often used for LDA is Gibbs sampling.\n",
    "Simply put, this starts with a random assignment of topics to words.\n",
    "Then, in each iteration, it reconsiders each word and recomputes what\n",
    "likely topics for that word are given the other topics in that document\n",
    "and the topics in which that word occurs in other documents. Thus, if a\n",
    "document already contains a number of words placed in a certain topic, a\n",
    "new word is more likely to be placed in that topic as well. After enough\n",
    "iterations, this converges to a solution.\n",

    "> **The Dirichlet Distribution and its Hyperparameters**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The Dirichlet distribution can be seen as a distribution over\n",
    "> multinomial distributions, that is, every draw from a Dirichlet\n",
    "> distribution results in a multinomial distribution. An easy way to\n",
    "> visualize this is to see the Dirichlet distribution as a bag of dice.\n",
    "> You draw a die from the bag, and each die is a distribution over the\n",
    "> numbers one to six.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This distribution is controlled by a parameter called alpha\n",
    "> ($\\alpha$), which is often called a *hyperparameter* because it is a\n",
    "> parameter that controls how other parameters (the actual topic\n",
    "> distributions) are estimated, similar to, e.g., the learning speed in\n",
    "> many machine learning models. This alpha hyperparameter controls what\n",
    "> kind of dice there are in the bag. A high alpha means that the dice\n",
    "> are generally fair, i.e., give a uniform multinomial distribution. For\n",
    "> topic models, this means that documents will in general contain an\n",
    "> even spread of multiple topics. A low alpha means that each die is\n",
    "> unfair in the sense of having a strong preference for some number(s),\n",
    "> as if these numbers are weighted. You can then draw a die that prefers\n",
    "> ones, or a die that prefers sixes. For topic models this means that\n",
    "> each document tends to have one or two dominant topics. Finally, alpha\n",
    "> can be symmetric (meaning dice are unfair, but randomly, so in the end\n",
    "> each topic has the same chance) or asymmetric (they are still unfair,\n",
    "> and now also favor some topics more than others). This would\n",
    "> correspond to some topics being more likely to occur in all documents.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In our experience, most documents actually do have one or two dominant\n",

    "\n",
    "Example <a href=\"#exm-lda\" class=\"quarto-xref\">14</a> shows how you can\n",
    "fit an LDA model in Python or R. As example data, we use Obama’s State\n",
    "of the Union Speeches using the corpus introduced in Chapter\n",
    "**?@sec-chap-dtm**. Since such a speech generally touches on many\n",
    "different topics, we choose to first split by paragraph as these will be\n",
    "more semantically coherent (for Obama, at least). In R, we use the\n",
    "`corpus_reshape` function to split the paragraphs, while in Python we\n",
    "use *pandas*’ `str.split`, which creates a list or paragraphs for each\n",
    "text, which we then convert into a paragraph per row using `explode`.\n",
    "Converting this to a DTM we get a reasonably sized matrix of 738\n",
    "paragraphs and 746 unique words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we fit the actual LDA model using the package *gensim* (Python)\n",
    "and *topicmodels* (R). Before we can do this, we need to convert the DTM\n",
    "format into a format accepted by that package. For Python, this is done\n",
    "using the `Sparse2Corpus` helper function while in R this is done with\n",
    "the *quanteda* `convert` function. Then, we fit the model, asking for 10\n",
    "topics to be identified in these paragraphs. There are three things to\n",
    "note in this line. First, we specify a *random seed* of 123 to make sure\n",
    "the analysis is replicable. Second, we specify an “asymmetric” of\n",
    "`1/1:10`, meaning the first topic has alpha 1, the second 0.5, etc. (in\n",
    "R). In Python, instead of using the default of `alpha='symmetric'`, we\n",
    "set `alpha='asymmetric'`, which uses the formula\n",
    "$\\frac{1}{topic\\_index + \\sqrt{num\\_topics}}$ to determine the priors.\n",
    "At the cost of a longer estimation time, we can even specify\n",
    "`alpha='auto'`, which will learn an asymmetric prior from the data. See\n",
    "the note on hyperparameters for more information. Third, for Python we\n",
    "also need to specify the vocabulary names since these are not included\n",
    "in the DTM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final line generates a data frame of top words per topic for first\n",
    "inspection (which in Python requires separating the words from their\n",
    "weights in a list comprehension and converting it to a data frame for\n",
    "easy viewing). As you can see, most topics are interpretable and\n",
    "somewhat coherent: for example, topic 1 seems to be about education and\n",
    "jobs, while topic 2 is health care. You also see that the word “job”\n",
    "occurs in multiple topics (presumably because unemployment was a\n",
    "pervasive concern during Obama’s tenure). Also, some topics like topic 3\n",
    "are relatively more difficult to interpret from this table. A possible\n",
    "reason for this is that not every paragraph actually has policy content.\n",
    "For example, the first paragraph of his first State of the Union was:\n",
    "*Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady\n",
    "of the United States – she’s around here somewhere*. None of these words\n",
    "really fit a “topic” in the normal meaning of that term, but all of\n",
    "these words need to be assigned a topic in LDA. Thus, you often see\n",
    "“procedural” or “boilerplate” topics such as topic 3 occurring in LDA\n",
    "outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, note that we showed the R results here. As *gensim* uses a\n",

    "### Validating and Inspecting Topic Models\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the previous subsection, running a topic model is\n",
    "relatively easy. However, that doesn’t mean that the resulting topic\n",
    "model will always be useful. As with all text analysis techniques,\n",
    "*validation* is the key to good analysis: are you measuring what you\n",
    "want to measure? And how do you know?\n",
    "\n",
    "For topic modeling (and arguably for all text analysis), the first step\n",
    "after fitting a model is inspecting the results and establishing face\n",
    "validity. Top words per topic such as those listed above are a good\n",
    "place to start, but we would really encourage you to also look at the\n",
    "top documents per topic to better understand how words are used in\n",
    "context. Also, it is good to inspect the relationships between topics\n",
    "and look at documents that load high on multiple topics to understand\n",
    "the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the only goal is to get an explorative understanding of the corpus,\n",
    "for example as a first step before doing a dictionary analysis or manual\n",
    "coding, just face validity is probably sufficient. For a more formal\n",
    "validation, however, it depends on the reason for using topic modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using topic modeling in a true unsupervised sense, i.e.,\n",
    "without a predefined analytic schema in mind, it is difficult to assess\n",
    "whether the model measures what you want to measure – because the whole\n",
    "point is that you don’t know what you want to measure. That said,\n",
    "however, you can have the general criteria that the model needs to\n",
    "achieve *coherence* and *interpretability*, meaning that words and\n",
    "documents that share a topic are also similar semantically.\n",
    "\n",
    "In their excellent paper on the topic, @chang09 propose two formal tasks\n",
    "to judge this using manual (or crowd) coding: in *word intrusion*, a\n",
    "coder is asked to pick the “odd one out” from a list where one other\n",
    "word is mixed in a group of topic words. In *topic intrusion*, the coder\n",
    "is presented with a document and a set of topics that occur in the\n",
    "document, and is asked to spot the one topic that was not present\n",
    "according to the model. In both tasks, if the coder is unable to\n",
    "identify the intruding word or topic, apparently the model does not fit\n",
    "our intuitive notion of “aboutness” or semantic similarity. Perhaps\n",
    "their most interesting finding is that goodness-of-fit measures like\n",
    "perplexity[1] are actually not good predictors of the interpretability\n",
    "of the resulting models.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using topic models in a more confirmatory manner, that is, if\n",
    "you wish the topics to match some sort of predefined categorization, you\n",
    "should use regular gold standard techniques for validation: code a\n",
    "sufficiently large random sample of documents with your predefined\n",
    "categories, and test whether the LDA topics match those categories. In\n",
    "general, however, in such cases it is a better idea to use a dictionary\n",
    "or supervised analysis technique as topic models often do not exactly\n",
    "capture our categories. After all, unsupervised techniques mainly excel\n",

    "### Beyond LDA\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter focused on regular or “vanilla” LDA topic modeling. Since\n",
    "the seminal publication, however, a large amount of variations and\n",
    "extensions on LDA have been proposed. These include, for example,\n",
    "*Dynamic Topic Models* (which incorporate time; @dynamiclda) and\n",
    "*Correlated Topic Models* (which explicitly model correlation between\n",
    "topics; @correlatedlda). Although it is beyond the scope of this book to\n",
    "describe these models in detail, the interested reader is encouraged to\n",
    "learn more about these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially noteworthy are *Structural Topic Models* (R package *stm*;\n",
    "@stm), which allow you to model covariates as topic or word predictors.\n",
    "This allows you, for example, to model topic shifts over time or\n",
    "different words for the same topic based on, e.g., Republican or\n",
    "Democrat presidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python users should check out *Hierarchical Topic Modeling*\n",
    "\\[@hierarchicallda\\]. In hierarchical topic modeling, rather than the\n",
    "researcher specifying a fixed number of topics, the model returns a\n",
    "hierarchy of topics from few general topics to a large number of\n",
    "specific topics, allowing for a more flexible exploration and analysis\n",
    "of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How many topics?**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> With topic modeling, the most important researcher choices are the\n",
    "> *number of topics* and the value of *alpha*. These choices are called\n",
    "> *hyperparameters*, since they determine how the model parameters\n",
    "> (e.g. words per topic) are found.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> There is no good theoretical solution to determine the “right” number\n",
    "> of topics for a given corpus and research question. Thus, a sensible\n",
    "> approach can be to ask the computer to try many models, and see which\n",
    "> works best. Unfortunately, because this is an unsupervised (inductive)\n",
    "> method, there is no single metric that determines how good a topic\n",
    "> model is.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> There are a number of such metrics proposed in the literature, of\n",
    "> which we will introduce two. *Perplexity* is a score of how well the\n",
    "> LDA model can fit (predict) the actual word distribution (or in other\n",
    "> words: how “perplexed” the model is seeing the corpus). *Coherence* is\n",
    "> a measure of how semantically coherent the topics are by checking how\n",
    "> often the top token co-occurs in documents in each topic \\[@mimno11\\].\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The code below shows how these can be calculated for a range of topic\n",
    "> counts, and the same code could be used for trying different values of\n",
    "> *alpha*. For both measures, lower values are better, and both\n",
    "> essentially keep decreasing as you add more topics. What you are\n",
    "> looking for is the *inflection point* (or “elbow point”) where it goes\n",
    "> from a steep decrease to a more gradual decrease. For coherence, this\n",
    "> seems to be at 10 topics, while for perplexity this is at 20 topics.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> There are two very important caveats to make here, however. First,\n",
    "> these metrics are no substitute for human validation and the best\n",
    "> model according to these metrics is not always the most interpretable\n",
    "> or coherent model. In our experience, most metrics give a higher topic\n",
    "> count that would be optimal from an interpretability perspective, but\n",
    "> of course that also depends on how we operationalize interpretability.\n",
    "> Nonetheless, these topic numbers are probably more indicative of a\n",
    "> range of counts that should be inspected manually, rather than giving\n",
    "> a definitive answer.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Second, the code below was written so it is easy to understand and\n",
    "> quick to run. For real use in a research project, it is advised to\n",
    "> include a broader range of topic counts and also vary the $\\alpha$.\n",
    "> Moreover, it is smart to run each count multiple times so you get an\n",
    "> indication of the variance as well as a single point (it is quite\n",
    "> likely that the local minimum for coherence at $k=10$ is an outlier\n",
    "> that will disappear if more runs are averaged). Finally, especially\n",
    "> for a goodness-of-fit measure like perplexity it is better to split\n",
    "> the data into a training and test set (see Section\n",
