    "## Deciding on the Right Method\n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking about the computational analysis of texts, it is important\n",
    "to realize that there is no method that is *the one* to do so. While\n",
    "there are good choices and bad choices, we also cannot say that one\n",
    "method is necessarily and always superior to another. Some methods are\n",
    "more fashionable than others. For instance, there has been a growing\n",
    "interest in topic models (see\n",
    "<a href=\"#sec-unsupervised\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Section 2.24</a>) in the\n",
    "past few years. There are indeed very good applications for such models,\n",
    "they are also sometimes applied to research questions and/or data where\n",
    "they make much less sense. As always, the choice of method should follow\n",
    "the research question and not the other way round. We therefore caution\n",
    "you about reading\n",
    "<a href=\"#sec-chap-text\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Section 1</a> selectively\n",
    "because you want, for instance, to learn about supervised machine\n",
    "learning or about unsupervised topic models. Instead, you should be\n",
    "aware of very different approaches to make an informed decision on what\n",
    "to use when.\n",
    "\n",
    "@Boumans2016 provide useful guidelines for this. They place automatic\n",
    "text analysis approaches on a continuum from deductive (or top-down) to\n",
    "inductive (or bottom-up). At the deductive end of the spectrum, they\n",
    "place dictionary approaches\n",
    "(<a href=\"#sec-dictionary\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Section 2.10</a>). Here,\n",
    "the researcher has strong *a priori* (theoretical) assumptions (for\n",
    "instance, which topics exist in a news data set; or which words are\n",
    "positive or negative) and can compile lists of words or rules based on\n",
    "these assumptions. The computer then only needs to execute these rules.\n",
    "At the inductive end of the spectrum, in contrast, lie approaches such\n",
    "as topic models\n",
    "(<a href=\"#sec-unsupervised\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Section 2.24</a>) where\n",
    "little or no *a priori* assumptions are made, and where we exploratively\n",
    "look for patterns in the data. Here, we typically do not know which\n",
    "topics exist in advance. Supervised approaches\n",
    "(<a href=\"#sec-supervised\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Section 2.14</a>) can be\n",
    "placed in between: here, we do define categories *a priori* (we do know\n",
    "which topics exist, and given an article, we know to which topic it\n",
    "belongs), but we do not have any set of rules: we do not know which\n",
    "words to look for or which exact rules to follow. These rules are to be\n",
    "“learned” by the computer from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the details and implementations, let us discuss some\n",
    "use cases of the three main approaches for the computational analysis of\n",
    "text: dictionary (or rule-based) approaches, supervised machine\n",
    "learning, and unsupervised machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary approaches excel under three conditions. First, the variable\n",
    "we want to code is *manifest and concrete* rather than *latent and\n",
    "abstract*: names of actors, specific physical objects, specific phrases,\n",
    "etc., rather than feelings, frames, or topics. Second, all synonyms to\n",
    "be included must be known beforehand. And third, the dictionary entries\n",
    "must not have multiple meanings. For instance, coding for how often gun\n",
    "control is mentioned in political speeches fits these criteria. There\n",
    "are only so many ways to talk about it, and it is rather unlikely that\n",
    "speeches about other topics contain a phrase like “gun control”.\n",
    "Similarly, if we want to find references to Angela Merkel, Donald Trump,\n",
    "or any other well-known politician, we can just directly search for\n",
    "their names – even though problems arise when people have very common\n",
    "surnames and are referred to by their surnames only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sadly, most interesting concepts are more complex to code. Take a\n",
    "seemingly straightforward problem: distinguishing whether a news article\n",
    "is about the economy or not. This is really easy to do for humans: there\n",
    "may be some edge cases, but in general, people rarely need longer than a\n",
    "few seconds to grasp whether an article is about the economy rather than\n",
    "about sports, culture, etc. Yet, many of these articles won’t directly\n",
    "state that they are about the economy by explicitly using the word\n",
    "“economy”.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may think of extending our dictionary not only with `econom.+` (a\n",
    "regular expression that includes economists, economic, and so on), but\n",
    "also come up with other words like “stock exchange”, “market”,\n",
    "“company.” Unfortunately, we will quickly run into a problem that we\n",
    "also faced when we discussed the precision-recall trade-off in\n",
    "**?@sec-validation**: the more terms we add to our dictionary, the more\n",
    "false positives we will get: articles about the geographical space\n",
    "called “market”, about some celebrity being seen in “company” of someone\n",
    "else, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this example, we can conclude that often (1) it is easy for humans\n",
    "to decide to which class a text belongs, but (2) it is very hard for\n",
    "humans to come up with a list of words (or rules) on which their\n",
    "judgment is based. Such a situation is perfect for applying supervised\n",
    "machine learning: after all, it won’t take us much time to annotate,\n",
    "say, 1000 articles based on whether they are about the economy or not\n",
    "(probably this takes less time than thoroughly fine tuning a list of\n",
    "words to include or exclude); and the difficult part, deciding on the\n",
    "exact rules underlying the decision to classify an article as economic\n",
    "is done by the computer in seconds. Supervised machine learning,\n",
    "therefore, has replaced dictionary approaches in many areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both dictionary (or rule-based) approaches and supervised machine\n",
    "learning assume that you know in advance which categories (positive\n",
    "versus negative; sports versus economy versus politics; …) exist. The\n",
    "big strength of unsupervised approaches such as topic models is that you\n",
    "can also apply them without this knowledge. They therefore allow you to\n",
    "find patterns in data that you did not expect and can generate new\n",
    "insights. This makes them particularly suitable for explorative research\n",
    "questions. Using them for confirmatory tests, in contrast, is less\n",
    "defensible: after all, if we are interested in knowing whether, say,\n",
    "news site A published more about the economy than news site B, then it\n",
    "would be a bit weird to pretend not to know that the topic “economy”\n",
    "exists. Also practically, mapping the resulting topics that the topic\n",
    "model produces onto such *a priori* existing categories can be\n",
    "challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite all differences, all approaches share one requirement: you need\n",
    "to “Validate. Validate. Validate” \\[@Grimmer2013\\]. Though it has been\n",
    "done in the past, simply applying a dictionary without comparing the\n",
    "performance to manual coding of the same concepts is not acceptable;\n",
    "neither is using a supervised machine learning classifier without doing\n",
    "the same; or blindly trusting a topic model without at least manually\n",
    "checking whether the scores the model assigns to documents really\n",
    "capture what the documents are about.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Obtaining a Review Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sections on dictionary and supervised approaches we will use a\n",
    "dataset of movie reviews from the IMDB database \\[@aclimdb\\]. This\n",
    "dataset is published as a compressed set of folders, with separate\n",

    "\n",
    "The IMDB dataset we will use is a relatively large file and it requires\n",

    "**?@exm-reviewdata**, which also serves as a nice example of how to\n",
    "download and process files. Both R and Python follow the same basic\n",

    "we read the data from that file. For R, we use the standard *RDS*\n",
    "format, while for Python we use a compressed *pickle* file. The format\n",
    "of the data is also slightly different, following the convention for\n",
    "each language: In R we use the data frame returned by `readtext`, which\n",
    "can read files from a folder or zip archive and return a data frame\n",
    "containing one text per row. In Python, we have separate lists for the\n",

    "### Putting Together a Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "With the knowledge we gained in previous chapters, it is not difficult\n",
    "to set up a supervised machine learning classifier to automatically\n",
    "determine, for instance, the topic of a news article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us recap the building blocks that we need. In\n",
    "**?@sec-chap-introsml**, you learned how to use different classifiers,\n",
    "how to evaluate them, and how to choose the best settings. However, in\n",
    "these examples, we used numerical data as features; now, we have text.\n",
    "In **?@sec-chap-dtm**, you learned how to turn text into numerical\n",
    "features. And that’s all we need to get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical examples for supervised machine learning in the analysis of\n",
    "communication include the classification of topics \\[e.g.,\n",
    "@Scharkow2011\\], frames \\[e.g., @Burscher2014\\], user characteristics\n",
    "such as gender or ideology, or sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider the case of sentiment analysis in more detail. Classical\n",
    "sentiment analysis is done with a dictionary approach: you take a list\n",
    "of positive words, a list of negative words, and count which occur more\n",
    "frequently. Additionally, one may attach a weight to each word, such\n",
    "that “perfect” gets a higher weight than “good”, for instance. An\n",
    "obvious drawback is that these pure bag-of-words approaches cannot cope\n",
    "with negation (“not good”) and intensifiers (“very good”), which is why\n",
    "extensions have been developed that take these (and other features, such\n",
    "as punctuation) into account \\[@Thelwall2012; @Hutto2014;\n",
    "@DeSmedt2012\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "But while available off-the-shelf packages that implement these extended\n",
    "dictionary-based methods are very easy to use (in fact, they spit out a\n",
    "sentiment score with one single line of code), it is questionable how\n",
    "well they work in practice. After all, “sentiment” is not exactly a\n",
    "clear, manifest concept for which we can enumerate a list of words. It\n",
    "has been shown that results obtained with multiple of these packages\n",
    "correlate very poorly with each other and with human annotations\n",
    "\\[@Boukes2019; @Chan2021\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, it has been suggested that it is better to use supervised\n",
    "machine learning to automatically code the sentiment of texts\n",
    "\\[@Gonzalez-Bailon2015; @vermeer2019seeing\\]. However, you may need to\n",
    "annotate documents from your own dataset: training a classifier on, for\n",
    "instance, movie reviews and then using it to predict sentiment in\n",
    "political texts violates the assumption that training set, test set, and\n",
    "the unlabeled data that are to be classified are (at least in principle\n",
    "and approximately) drawn from the same population.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the workflow, we will use the ACL IMDB dataset, a large\n",
    "dataset that consists of a training dataset of 25000 movie reviews (of\n",
    "which 12500 are positive and 12500 are negative) and an equally sized\n",

    "they belong (`test` or `train`) and their label (`pos` and `neg`). This\n",
    "means that we cannot simply use a pre-defined function to read them, but\n",
    "we need to think of a way of reading the content into a data structure\n",
    "that we can use. This data was loaded in **?@exm-reviewdata** above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sparse versus dense matrices in Python and R\n",
    "\n",
    "In a document-term matrix, you would typically find a lot of zeros: most\n",
    "words do *not* appear in any given document. For instance, the reviews\n",
    "in the IMDB dataset contain more than 100000 unique words. Hence, the\n",
    "matrix has more than 100000 columns. Yet, most reviews only consist of a\n",
    "couple of hundred words. As a consequence, more than 99% of the cells in\n",
    "the table contain a zero. In a sparse matrix, we do not store all these\n",
    "zeros, but only store the values for cells that actually contain a\n",
    "value. This drastically reduces the memory needed. But even if you have\n",
    "a huge amount of memory, this does not solve the issue: in R, the number\n",
    "of cells in a matrix is limited to 2147483647. It is therefore\n",
    "impossible to store a matrix with 100000 features and 25000 documents as\n",
    "a dense matrix. Unfortunately, many models that you can run via *caret*\n",
    "in R will convert your sparse document-term matrix to a dense matrix,\n",
    "and hence are effectively only usable for very small datasets. An\n",
    "alternative is using the *quanteda* package, which does use sparse\n",
    "matrices throughout. However, at the time of writing this book, quanteda\n",
    "only provides a very limited number of models. As all of these problems\n",
    "do not arise in *scikit-learn*, you may want to consider using Python\n",
    "for many text classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now train our first classifier. We choose a Naïve Bayes\n",
    "classifier with a simple count vectorizer (**?@exm-imdbbaseline**). In\n",
    "the Python example, pay attention to the fitting of the vectorizer: we\n",
    "fit on the training data *and* transform the training data with it, but\n",
    "we only transform the test data *without re-fitting the vectorizer*.\n",
    "Fitting, here, includes the decision about which words to include (by\n",
    "definition, words that are not present in the training data are not\n",
    "included; but we could also choose additional constraints, such as\n",
    "excluding very rare or very common words), but also assigning an\n",
    "(internally used) identifier (variable name) to each word. If we fit the\n",
    "classifier again, these would not be compatible any more. In R, the same\n",
    "is achieved in a slightly different way: two term-document matrices are\n",
    "created independently, before they are matched in such a way that only\n",
    "the features that are present in the training matrix are retained in the\n",
    "test matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "A word that is not present in the training data, but is present in the\n",
    "test data, is thus ignored. If you want to use the information such\n",
    "out-of-vocabulary words can entail (e.g., they may be synonyms),\n",
    "consider using a word embedding approach (see **?@sec-wordembeddings**)\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not necessarily expect this first model to be the best classifier\n",

    "### Using the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have focused on training and evaluating models, almost\n",
    "forgetting why we were doing this in the first place: to use them to\n",
    "predict the label for new data that we did not annotate.\n",

    "space and of copyright and/or privacy if you want to share your\n",
    "classifier with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it makes sense to save both our classifier and our vectorizer\n",
    "to a file, so that we can reload them later (Example **?@exm-reuse**).\n",
    "Keep in mind that you have to re-use *both* – after all, the columns of\n",
    "your feature matrix will be different (and hence, completely useless for\n",
    "the classifier) when fitting a new vectorizer. Therefore, as you see,\n",
    "you do not do any fitting any longer, and only use the `.transform()`\n",
    "method of the (already fitted) vectorizer and the `.predict()` method of\n",
    "the (already fitted) classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In R, you have no vectorizer you could save – but because in contrast to\n",
    "Python, both your DTM and your classifier include the feature names, it\n",
    "suffices to save the classifier only (using\n",
    "`saveRDS(myclassifier, \"myclassifier.rds\")`) and using on a new DTM\n",
    "later on. You do need to remember, though, how you constructed the DTM\n",
    "(e.g., which preprocessing steps you took), to make sure that the\n",
