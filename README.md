These teaching materials are used by the COST network OPINION.


## COpA
We will use these materials during the [COST Action Training School in Salamanca, Spain](https://www.opinion-network.eu/updates/cost-action-training-school-in-salamanca-spain_2023-11-07).

### Friday, 2024-06-14, 12:30-13:30: "Machine Learning for opinion research"
In this short one-hour session, we will mainly discuss the what machine learning is, how supervised and unsupervised methods differ, and how they can be relevant for opinion research. You can find the slides [here](intro-ml.pdf).

### Friday, 2024-06-14, 15:00-16:45 "Supervised text classification"
In this this hands-on session, we will build our own classifiers. For this, we are essentially following [Chapter 8](https://v2.cssbook.net/content/chapter08.html) and parts of  [Chapter 11](https://v2.cssbook.net/content/chapter11.html) of the book *Computational Analysis of Communication* by Wouter van Atteveldt, Damian Trilling, and Carlos Arcila Calder√≥n. Materials:

- [slides](sml.pdf)
